## Sales-Data-Analysis

### Dataset overview:
The dataset consists of 12 CSV files, each representing sales data for one month of the year 2019. Each file contains between 9,000 and 26,000 rows and six columns: Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Price Each, Order Date, and Purchase Address.

### Steps followed:

Data Processing: Involved cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is the heart of this project, where we explore and analyze the data to gain insights.

Sales Analysis: We try answering some basic questions an analyst might be asked, such as:
- Find best months for overall product sales
- Which days in a week have highest sales? What is the revenue trend?
- What are some of the peak sale hours?
- Which products are sold the most?
- What are the top products sold in each city?
- What are the products earning maximum revenue?
- What is the percentage of orders with multiple products?
- Which cities generate the most revenue?
- Which are the cities that sold maximum products?
- Which products are commonly bought together?
- What is the distribution of orders across states?

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, our analysis of the sales data has uncovered key insights that are vital for driving strategic decisions in the e-commerce business. These findings include identifying peak sales periods, top-performing products, and the highest revenue-generating cities. Leveraging these insights, the business can optimize operations, refine marketing strategies, and enhance customer targeting to maximize revenue growth. Ongoing analysis and continuous monitoring of sales trends will be essential to stay ahead of market shifts and maintain a competitive edge in the fast-evolving e-commerce landscape.
